            <h2>Royal Decree No. 001 — Succession Protocol</h2>
            <pre>
Date Issued: 31/07/25

Whereas the continuity of the Penguinize Arctic Island Nation (PAIN) and the dignity of its sovereign office are of paramount importance; and

Whereas the preservation of rightful succession safeguards the stability and honor of the realm;

It is hereby ordained as follows:

1. Upon the demise of the reigning Emperor Penguin, a thorough and impartial investigation carried out by “Penguin Guards” and two Puffins shall be conducted to determine the circumstances surrounding said event.

2. Should evidence arise implicating any individual named within the Emperor’s Last Will and Testament in the Emperor’s untimely demise, such individual shall be irrevocably disqualified from succession to the throne or any claim thereof.

3. In the absence of culpability ascertained through investigation, succession shall proceed according to the following order of precedence:
   a. The Empress Penguin, if duly designated;
   b. The Eldest Prince or Princess of the Imperial Line;
   c. A duly appointed member of the Arch Puffin Council.

4. In the unlikely event that all aforementioned successors are found culpable or otherwise incapacitated, the sovereignty of PAIN shall be transferred to an allied Micronation, on the condition that the penguin populace shall continue to flourish unhindered within the absorbing nation.

Let this decree stand as the unassailable foundation for the governance of succession within the Penguinize Arctic Island Nation, ensuring order, justice, and the eternal prosperity of the realm.

By my imperial authority,  
Emperor Penguin Pei Sen Liang  
Sovereign of PAIN
